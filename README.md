# Detego Stocktake Read Events Dataset

This dataset was introduced in the paper "RFID in the Wild - Analyzing Stocktake Data to Determine Detection Probabilities of Products".

The dataset consists of two parts:

1. Information about the individual stocktakes
2. The read events of individual stocktakes 

Note: As this paper is currently under review, this repository does only contain a sample of the dataset.
